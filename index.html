                Hello!
            </h2>
            <div class="mainContent__text">
                <p>After earning my degree in Photographic Technology and working as a professional photograher for nine years, I decided to explore the world of Front-End Web Development. I built a few small projects, aqcuired a few mentors in the field, and soon after it became apparent: I love this and must learn all I can about coding. Now I am preparing for a career shift from photography to front-end development and am very excited to join a field that is always growing, changing and in which I can always find new ways to contribute. As I continue to hone my developer skills, to face challenges, solve them, and move on to the next challenge, my desire and dedication to learn and grow only multiply. Whether by completing a code-a-long in a Udemy course or by attending an in-person <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a> workshop, learning something new each day motives me. Writing better code today than the day before drives me forward.
                </p>
                <p>Below is a sample of the projects on which I'm currently working, all of which are currently works in progress and which I am very excited to improve, grow, and add to over the coming weeks and months. If you'd like to chat more please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> or visit <a href="http://www.github.com/tabbatharenea" target="_blank">my Github</a> to see more of my work.</p>
